# NetworkManipulation
This python script performs fundamental social network analysis tasks on the temporal network graph for the StackOverflow-related dataset [1].
<br>
On each execution, a dedicated folder is created containing all result files.
<br>
Script calculates tmin and tmax timestamps and splits records in N sub-networks.
<br>
For each sub-network, the following are calculated:
- Various centralities (e.g. Degree, Closeness, Eigenvector, etc.)
- Similarity tables (e.g. Graph Distance, Jaccard's Coefficient, etc.)
- Metrics predictions of consecutive sub-networks

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8.5(x64)
- numpy latest
- networkx latest
- pandas latest
- matplotlib latest
- scipy latest

## Usage
Before executing any script, install required dependencies:
```
% pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```
A test network file(sub-set) has been provided to play with!
<br>
Execute the script:
```
% python NetworkManipulation.py
```
Execution example:
```
❯ python NetworkManipulation.py
